# Tunisian Programming Language (TPL) Interpreter

Welcome to the **Tunisian Programming Language (TPL) Interpreter**! This project is an implementation of a programming language inspired by the Tunisian dialect, allowing users to write and execute code using familiar Tunisian phrases. The interpreter is built using JavaScript and provides a web-based interface for writing and running TPL code.

You can view and interact with the project here: [TPL Interpreter on CodePen](https://codepen.io/faresbrayek2/pen/rNXzVrP)
